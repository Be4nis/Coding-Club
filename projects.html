							Simple Messages: Assign a message to a variable, and print that message. 
                            Then change the value of the variable to a new message, and print the new 
                            message
                            <br><br>
                            Personal Message: Use a variable to store a user inputed name, and print 
                            a message to that person. Your message should be simple, such as, “Hello Eric, 
                            how are you?”
							<br><br>
                            Favorite Number: Use a variable to represent your favorite number. Then, 
                           	using that variable, create a message that reveals your favorite number. Print 
                            that message.
							<br><br>
                            Find a random quote from a famous person. Print the 
                           	quote and the name of its author. Your output should look something like the 
                            following, including the quotation marks:
							<br>
                            Albert Einstein once said, “A person who never made a 
                            mistake never tried anything new.”
							<br>
							(Hint: Use quotes to print the string and apostrophes for the quotation marks in the string)
                            <br><br>
                            Get a user to input their favourite color. Then if their favourite color is the same as your favourite colour, print Great, {color} is my favourite colour to. If it isn’t the same as your favourite colour print Your opinion is wrong.
                            <br><br>
                            Assign a variable that is all upper case. Then ask for a user input which is lowercase. Then check to see if the input is the same as the variable. 
                            For example var = “ASDASDASD” user = input(“asdasdasd”) This should print out these have the same letters.
                            If you have time/"|"
                            You can also try asking f/./or an email, then enter the email like: zHAnBr@GMaiL.Com. after that check if the email ends with @gmail.com, if it does print out that is a valid email. If it doesn’t print out you didn’t use @gmail.com
                            </p>

                            <ul>Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.								<li>Then write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.</li>
                            <li>Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. [The version that fails (alien color isn't green.) will have no output.]</li> 
							<br>		
							After that see if you can get a user to input the alien_color (You should only need to change one line of code.)
                            <br>
                            Choose a color for an alien as you did in the Exercise above and
                            write an if-else chain.
                            <ul>
								<li>If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.</li>
                	            <li>If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.</li>
                    	        <li>Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.</li>
                            <br>
							</ul>
                            Now, Turn your if-else chain into an if-elif-else chain.
                            <ul>
								<li>If the alien is green, print a message that the player earned 5 points.</li>
                                <li>If the alien is yellow, print a message that the player earned 10 points.</li>
                                <li>If the alien is red, print a message that the player earned 15 points.</li>
                                <li>Write three different variables containing each color, making sure each message is printed
                            for the appropriate color alien.</li>
							</ul>
							<br>			
							<ul>Write an if-elif-else chain that determines a person’s stage of life. Set a value for the variable age, and then:
								<li>If the person is less than 2 years old, print a message that the person is a baby.</li>
								<li>If the person is at least 2 years old but less than 4, print a message that the person is a toddler.</li>
								<li>If the person is at least 4 years old but less than 13, print a message that the person is a kid.</li>
								<li> If the person is at least 13 years old but less than 20, print a message that the person is a teenager.</li>
								<li>If the person is at least 20 years old but less than 65, print a message that the person is an adult.</li>
								<li>If the person is age 65 or older, print a message that the person is an elder.</li>
							</ul>
							<br>
							<ul>Make a list of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your list.
								<li>Make a list of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.</li>
								<li>Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your list. If the fruit is in your list, the if block should print a statement, such as "You really like bananas!"</li>
							</ul>
							<br><br>			
                            <span class="date">Thursday, May 5th</span>

							<ul>
								The election is coming up! Get a user to input their age and see if they’re allowed to vote. 
								<li>If the user is 18 years old print you are exactly the right age to vote.</li>
								<li>If the user is 15 to 17 years old, tell the user that they can vote in a few years</li>
								<li>If the user is below 5 years old, ask the user if they are lying</li>
								<li>If the user is between 19 and 30 ask the user how their day is going</li>
								<li>If the user is 30 to 60 ask the user if they have had a midlife crisis</li>
								<li>If the user is between 60 to 100, tell the user that you hope they are having a good day.</li>
								<li>If the user is over 100, appreciate them. Give them compliments :)</li>
							</ul>
							<ul>If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people you’d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.
								<br><br> 
									<li>You just heard that one of your guests can’t make the dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations. You’ll have to think of someone else to invite. Start with your program from the exercise above and add a print() call at the end of your program stating the names of the guest who can’t make it.</li> 
									<li>Next, Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can’t make it with the name of the new person you are inviting and print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still in your list.</li>
									<br>
									You just found a bigger dinner table, so now more space is available. Think of three more guests to invite to dinner. 
									<li>Add a print() call to the end of your program informing people that you found a bigger dinner table.</li>
									<li>Use insert() to add one new guest to the beginning of your list.</li>
									<li>Use insert() to add one new guest to the middle of your list.</li>
									<li>Use append() to add one new guest to the end of your list.</li>
									<li>Print a new set of invitation messages, one for each person in your list</li><br>
									You just found out that your new dinner table won’t arrive in time for the dinner, and you have space for only two guests. Start with your program from the project above. 
									<br>
									<li>Add a new line that prints a message saying that you can invite only two people for dinner.</li>
									<li>Use pop() to remove guests from your list one at a time until only two names remain in your list. Each time you pop a name from your list, print a message to that person letting them know you’re sorry you can’t invite them to dinner. </li>
									<li>Print a message to each of the two people still on your list, letting them know they’re still invited. </li>
									<li>Use del to remove the last two names from your list, so you have an empty list. Print your list to make sure you actually have an empty list at the end of your program.</li>
